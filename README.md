# zeely-react-test-task
Test assignment — implementation of an avatar background generation sidebar.  The task is to build a sidebar that opens via a "Change background" button and contains the avatar background generation flow.  Since the main screen is not part of the task, the project includes a simple trigger button to open the sidebar.
